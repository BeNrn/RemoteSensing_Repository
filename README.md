# RemoteSensing_Repository
 This repository contains code from the Remote Sensing Course I participated. The aim of the course was to develop a tree delineation algorithm using only cheap and easy to record  remote sensing data.

## Data acquisition
 Building on RGB-recordings

## Tree delineation algorithm

## Forest structure analysis

## Tree species forcast

# RemoteSensing_Repository
 This repository contains code from the Remote Sensing Course I participated. The aim of the course was to develop a tree delineation algorithm using only cheap and easy to record  remote sensing data.

## 1 Data acquisition
 Building on RGB-recordings

## 2 Tree delineation algorithm

## 3 Forest structure analysis

## 4 Tree species forcast

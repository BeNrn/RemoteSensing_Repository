# RemoteSensing_Repository
 This repository contains code from the Remote Sensing Course I participated. The aim of the course was to develop a tree delineation algorithm using only cheap and easy to record  remote sensing data.

## 1 Data acquisition
 Building on RGB-recordings and LiDAR data only considerably high amount of information can be extracted from aerial forest scenes without using multispectral information. Derivable Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and Digital Terrain Models (DTM) allow calculating a Canopy Height Model (CHM). Additionally, using the RGB-channels a variety of vegetation indizes can be calculated like the *Visible Vegetation Index* or the *Green Leaf Index*. Furthermore, spatial filters and the primary component analysis provide deeper insights. 

## 2 Tree delineation algorithm
 The study covers three experimental tree delineation algorithms and present their results:
  - itcSegment
  - ForestTools
  - lidR
 
## 3 Forest structure analysis

## 4 Tree species forcast
